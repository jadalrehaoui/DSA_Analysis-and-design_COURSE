Data structure analysis and design

# Scenario 1

The academic advisors in the Computer Science department at ABCU are very happy with the pseudocode you completed. You are now prepared to move forward with expanding the pseudocode to directly respond to the two items advising hopes to accomplish with this program. Remember, your program will need to do the following:

*Print a list of all the Computer Science courses in alphanumeric order.
*For a given course, print out its title and prerequisites.
*You will be writing pseudocode to address each of advisingâ€™s requirements, and you will do so for each of the data structures you already started to 
explore in the previous assignments (vector, hash table, and tree). Then you will perform a runtime analysis to determine which data structure will be the
best to use when you begin coding in the next project.

In this repo, I have added the document that explains it all, by analyzing the code and calculating it's time complexity. 
I have studied and analyzed vectors, Hashtables, and trees 

# Scenario 2

The academic advisors in the Computer Science department at ABCU are very happy with the planning and design you have completed for the advising assistance
software. They have decided they would like you to move forward with writing the code for the application so the department advisors can start using this 
to help when they talk with students.

For this given I added the folders DSA_Project and Final_project, I found that practicing on all the data structure would be a good one so I did both 
Doubly linked list and Hashtables. I tried to sort the Hashtable but it didn't work. I am more confident about the doubly linked list.

Thanks for seeing this ! I hope it helped you out !
